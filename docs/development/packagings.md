## Snap

Idk how to do that, havent looked into it and not sure if worth it.


## Appimage

AppImages are built by the sqgipkg release path below.


## sqgipkg release path

Jorts has a `sqgipkg.json` manifest and a GitHub release workflow that builds:

- `dist-linux-x86_64/Jorts.AppImage`
- `dist-linux-aarch64/Jorts.AppImage`
- `dist-windows-x86_64/Jorts-Setup.exe`

This is release plumbing, not a replacement for Meson.

Meson should still own as much of the app build as possible:

- project version, app id, app path, and generated `Config.vala`
- gresource, gschema, desktop, metainfo, and translations
- the Windows executable resources
- the manual Windows `deploy.sh` and NSIS template in `windows/`
- compiling the app itself

sqgipkg plugs into that by calling Meson, then staging the runtime bits that a
portable bundle needs. In other words: if another packaging method appears
later, it should still be able to start from the Meson build without needing to
copy sqgipkg-specific logic.

The manifest currently does this:

- Builds Linux AppImages for x86_64 and aarch64 from Ubuntu noble package data.
- Builds GTK and Granite from pinned upstream tags for the Linux AppImage path,
  so the AppImages do not depend on whatever Granite/GTK version the CI host has.
- Builds the Windows executable with Meson and MinGW, then stages MSYS2 runtime
  packages into a Windows directory and wraps that directory in an NSIS installer
  using the `nsis_options` in `sqgipkg.json`.
- Stages GTK settings, schemas, themes, icon themes, pixbuf SVG loading support,
  fonts, app icons, and the app metadata needed by the bundles.

Important icon/theme detail: the app uses the elementary GTK stylesheet on all
platforms, but Windows uses the Adwaita icon theme. The Windows split avoids
elementary symbolic SVGs that GTK's Windows renderer can resolve but fails to
draw. If icons disappear while the theme still works, check `sqgipkg.json`
first:

- Linux package lists should include `elementary-icon-theme`.
- Windows package lists should include `mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme`
  and `mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme-legacy`.
- Both bundles also need SVG icon loading support (`librsvg`/gdk-pixbuf loader
  data), because many symbolic icons are SVG files. On Windows, keep
  `mingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2` explicit so the bundle includes
  `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe` for the runtime loader cache.
- Windows also stages `windows/loaders.cache` into
  `lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache`. Without that default cache, direct
  launches can resolve icon names but fail to decode SVG toolbar icons.

### Local build commands

The release workflow checks out sqgi at `v0.1.0-alpha.1`. For local testing,
use the same checkout or pass the same source directory that CI uses:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0-alpha.1 https://github.com/supercamel/sqgi.git ../sqgi
cmake -S ../sqgi -B ../sqgi/build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSQ_ENABLE_JIT=ON
cmake --build ../sqgi/build
sudo cmake --install ../sqgi/build --prefix /usr/local
sudo ldconfig
```

Then from the Jorts source tree:

```bash
sqgipkg --target appimage --appimage-arch x86_64 --sqgi-source-dir ../sqgi
sqgipkg --target appimage --appimage-arch aarch64 --sqgi-source-dir ../sqgi
sqgipkg --target win-nsis --sqgi-source-dir ../sqgi
```

For quicker Windows debugging, build only the staged directory:

```bash
sqgipkg --target win-dir --sqgi-source-dir ../sqgi
```

That writes `dist-windows-x86_64/Jorts`, which is easier to inspect than the
installer. For example, if Windows icons are broken, check that
`dist-windows-x86_64/Jorts/share/icons/elementary` exists and that
`dist-windows-x86_64/Jorts/etc/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` says
`gtk-icon-theme-name=elementary`.

### GitHub release workflow

The release workflow lives at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

It runs on plain version tags like `4.2.1`. Jorts release tags are `x.y.z`,
not `vX.Y.Z`.

The workflow:

1. Checks out Jorts.
2. Checks out sqgi at `v0.1.0-alpha.1`.
3. Builds and installs sqgi/sqgipkg.
4. Runs sqgipkg for both Linux AppImages and the Windows NSIS installer.
5. Uploads the artifacts.
6. Creates or updates the GitHub release for the tag.

To trigger a release build, push a plain version tag:

```bash
git tag -a 4.2.1 -m "4.2.1"
git push origin 4.2.1
```

For test runs, prefer a temporary branch or workflow dispatch when possible.
If a real version tag is reused for testing, remember that force-moving tags can
confuse anyone watching releases.


## DEB/RPM/etc

Is there demand? I dont wanna bother with that...
For packagers: A tweak would be to have Jorts create a data directory instead of using its root.

Jorts just checks whether DATA_DIR exists since in a fresh sandbox it isnt a given, then just dump into it with no regards (since it is expected it does not share the space with other apps) 

Windows has a check in place, you can just remove the "#if WINDOWS"-"#endif" plumbing, and ensure Jorts create a folder with rdnn instead of just "Jorts" (there is no way to rebase between app-id on windows and other apps dont use rdnn anyway)


## Mac OS

[An attempt has been made](https://github.com/elly-code/jorts/pull/115)

The big hurdles are:
- DBus isnt a thing on MacOS
- Just like Windows, no LibPortal
- CSS theming seems broken?
- It apparently is crashy
